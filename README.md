# Prerequisites
Python 3.9+ with pip. Get it at [python.org](http://www.python.org). When downloading on windows, make sure to add Python to your PATH.

# How to install


Go to releases, then click the first zip file.

# After that...

Open a terminal window
and type in...

# MacOS and Linux
```
cd /path/to/file
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 snake.py
```

# Windows
```
cd /path/to/file
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python snake.py
```
### Important Note

I am using snake.py as an example you can run whatever script you want.

On windows, you can type 
```
dir
```
or
```
ls
```
On MacOS and Linux, you can type,
```
ls
```
to list all files in a directory
