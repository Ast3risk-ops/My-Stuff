# Prerequisites
Python 3.9+ with pip. Get it at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). When downloading on windows, make sure to add Python to your PATH.

# How to install


Click on Code, then, download ZIP.
Extract the zip to a directory of your choice

# After that...

Open a terminal window
and type in...

# MacOS and Linux
```bash
cd /path/to/file
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 snake.py
```

# Windows
```bash
cd /path/to/file
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python snake.py
```
### Important Note

I am using snake.py as an example, you can run whatever script you want.

On windows, you can type: 
```bash
dir
```
or
```bash
ls
```
On MacOS and Linux, you can type,
```bash
ls
```
to list all files in a directory

# Making exe

You can make exe files out of .py files by opening a terminal (On windows, right click start then click Windows PowerShell) and typing 
```bash 
pip install auto-py-to-exe
```
then type...
```bash
auto-py-to-exe
```
Then just select the script and type and name and hit Convert.
